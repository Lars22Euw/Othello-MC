# Othello
The board game Othello/Reversi implemented for Minecraft Version 1.12 using functions.
### Installation:
a) Clone this repo into `.minecraft/saves` where the name for this repo = world name.
Then create a new world with the same name.
If done correctly, all functions are in the right directory.

b) Copy all files into an already existing world. make sure that no namespaces overlap.

Now you can execute `/reload` and `/function othello:init` ingame to get startet.


### Credits:
Thanks to TheLordCthulhu for his build.
